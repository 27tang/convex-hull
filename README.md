######point-set-generator:
      creates a set of random points and outputs to stdout
          usage:
                  point-set-generator [number of points desired] [output range]

######grapher:
      takes a set of points generated by point-set-generator from stdin and plots them on a cartesian 
      graph
            usage: grapher < [input file]
            
######brute-force:
      takes set of points from stdin and outputs a set of lines (edges of the convex-hull) -- uses the      
      brute-force algorithm.
          usage:
                  brute-force < [input file]
      
######quick-hull:
      takes set of points from stdin and outputs a set of lines (edges of the convex-hull) -- uses the      
      quickhull algorithm.
          usage:
                  quick-hull < [input file]
